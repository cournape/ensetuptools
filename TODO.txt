Enhancements:

 * ability to use .egg_info files located alongside the .egg file for
   getting dependency information (not complete)

 * when a post install (pre uninstall) script is executed for a zip-safe
   egg, the entire egg is currently unzipped, instead of just pulling
   out the single script file.


Bugs:
