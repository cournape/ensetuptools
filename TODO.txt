Enhancements:

 * ability to use .egg_info files located alongside the .egg file for
   getting dependency information (not complete)


Bugs:

 * Install requirements (and its dependencies) need to be
   installed (if necessary) prior to running the postinstall script.

 * When specifying a package with the wrong format, e.g.
   > easy_install -rN ply==2.5.0001
   The user is presented with a long traceback, instead of a
   useful warning or error message.
