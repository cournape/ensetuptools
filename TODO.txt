Enhancements:

 * Add support for writing (or appending) all output to a specified logfile.
   This is useful when other programs run easy_install during an install
   or uninstall process.  This should be done using the standard python
   logging module (sell also PEP 282) instead of distutils.log since it is
   depricated and undocumented.

 * ability to use .egg_info files located alongside the .egg file for
   getting dependency information (not complete)


Bugs:

 * When specifying a package with the wrong format, e.g.
   > easy_install -rN ply==2.5.0001
   The user is presented with a long traceback, instead of a
   useful warning or error message.
