Enhancements:

 * ability to use .egg_info files located alongside the .egg file for
   getting dependency information (not complete)
   What is the standard file extension?
   - in setuptools I see '.egg-info'
   - in the buildsystem '.egg.info'
   - I've also seen '.egg_info'
   I think we should settle on some standard here.

 * Explicitly list PyPI repository in .enstallerrc
   - When first created the config file should contain only PyPI
   - The list of repositories should always be retreived from the config
     file, such that removing PyPI from the config file will deactivate PyPI
   - When the config file can not be opened for writing/reading
     a warning is displayed to the user:
       "WARNING: could not open .enstallerrc, using PyPI http://..."
   - Do we really need the "unstable_repos" ?
     What are they good for ?

 * Add upload repository section to .enstallerrc, could default to
   repository "1".


Bugs:

 * The subprocess calls to 'enpkg' should not assume that 'enpkg' is
   on the path, but instead specify the full path to the desired enpkg.
   Just calling 'enpkg' is in fact problematic on susytems which already
   have 'enpkg' installed.

 * Post install script may get run multiple during the install process.
