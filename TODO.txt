Enhancements:

 * ability to use .egg_info files located alongside the .egg file for
   getting dependency information (not complete)

 * when a post install (pre uninstall) script is executed for a zip-safe
   egg, the entire egg is currently unzipped, instead of just pulling
   out the single script file.

 * Explicitly list PyPI repository in .enstallerrc
   - When first created the config file should contain only PyPI
   - The list of repositories should always be retreived from the config
     file, such that removing PyPI from the config file will deactivate PyPI
   - When the config file can not be opened for writing/reading
     a warning is displayed to the user:
       "WARNING: could not open .enstallerrc, using PyPI http://..."
   - Do we really need the "unstable_repos" ?
     What are they good for ?
