Enhancements:

 * ability to use .egg_info files located alongside the .egg file for
   getting dependency information (not complete)
   What is the standard file extension?
   - in setuptools I see '.egg-info'
   - in the buildsystem '.egg.info'
   - I've also seen '.egg_info'
   I think we should settle on some standard here.

 * Explicitly list PyPI repository in .enstallerrc
   - When first created the config file should contain only PyPI
   - The list of repositories should always be retreived from the config
     file, such that removing PyPI from the config file will deactivate PyPI
   - When the config file can not be opened for writing/reading
     a warning is displayed to the user:
       "WARNING: could not open .enstallerrc, using PyPI http://..."
   - Do we really need the "unstable_repos" ?
     What are they good for ?

 * Add upload repository section to .enstallerrc, could default to
   repository "1".
