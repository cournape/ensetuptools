The original setuptools was originally written by Phillip J. Eby.

The following people have written patches for setuptools, which
were rejected by Phil Eby, but are now contained (along with other
changes) in Enstaller's setuptools replacement:
  - Chris Galvan
  - Chris Casey
  - Dave Martin

Corran Webster is the original author of Enstaller itself (that is
without setuptools).

Travis Oliphant has merged setuptools into Enstaller, and added
functionality to setuptools, as well as fixes some bugs.

Enstaller is maintained by Ilan Schnell.

Many people at Enthought have provided feedback, and given suggestions,
in particular Dave Peterson.
