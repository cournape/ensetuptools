The original setuptools was originally written by Phillip J. Eby.

The following people have written patches for setuptools that are
now included in Enstaller, along with other changes:
  - Chris Galvan
  - Chris Casey
  - Dave Martin

Corran Webster is the original author of Enstaller v3.0 itself (that is
without setuptools).   Rick Ratzel wrote the previous versions of Enstaller.

Travis Oliphant has merged setuptools into Enstaller, and added
functionality to setuptools, as well as fixes some bugs.

Enstaller is maintained by Ilan Schnell.

Many people at Enthought have provided feedback, and given suggestions,
in particular Dave Peterson.
